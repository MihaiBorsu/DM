Best of: 20 Easy Weeknight Meals While Staying Safely At Home
Our most popular series, Easy Weeknight Meals (over 5 years and counting) is where I ask friends to share what dinners are in heavy rotation for a busy weeknight. I’ve tried so many of the delicious recipes featured, and collected the best of them while you’re staying safely at home…
Black Bean Tacos with Avocado Sweet Corn Salad. “My friend Erin has the most amazingly simple and healthy recipes on her site, Naturally Ella. This one’s my favorite for weeknights because it’s so easy and delicious. The zesty lime and spiced beans are a big hit! Using handmade tortillas makes a big difference. If it’s a really busy night I use canned corn and canned black beans. If I have some on hand, I add five minute pickled onions for an extra pop of color.”
Fettuccine with shredded zucchini, fresh ricotta and lemon zest. “My youngest son loves to get involved in the kitchen and can do with this recipe by helping to grate the zucchini. This is a dish that I like to sprinkle some chili flakes onto for some extra zing.”
Bulgogi with Kimchi. “Put your piece of beef in the freezer 30 min. to 1 hour before you begin to cut, it’s easier to get very thin pieces. You can cut and marinate the day or morning before. Once that part is done, it comes together really quickly. Serve with kimchi (usually found in the refrigerator section next to the produce) and rice. Here’s the recipe I love from Savory Sweet Life.”
Vegetarian Lentil Soup.“I came across this recipe years ago when I was searching for meals that were high in iron to feed my vegetarian babies. This meal is SUPER easy to make and my kids wish they could eat it every night. I serve this soup with a side of warm pita for dipping”.
